This is the Guard's keystore directory. If the keystore named in the file:
WEB-INF/guanxi_sp_guard/config/guanxi-sp-guard.xml : Keystore
does not exist, the Guard will create it automatically when it starts up.
The keystore is used to store the Guard's certificate for communicating
via HTTPS with an Engine.
